Professor Matuszyńska studied mathematics in Gdańsk, Poland (2006-2011) and drug discovery and development in Abeerdeen, United Kingdom (2012-2013). She received her PhD from the Heinrich-Heine University of Düsseldorf (2016) for her work on developing mathematical models of light acclimation of photosynthetic organisms. During her training she has been a visiting researcher in experimental groups at Université de Genève (Switzerland), CEA - Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (Grenoble, France), and National Institute for Basic Biology (Japan), receiving training in spectrometry. For her postdoc, she continue her work on developing models of full electron transport chain within the German Cluster of Excellence on Plant Scienice (2018). In 2019 she has been awarded the individual Research Grant from the DFG to study the bioenergetics of photosynthetic glandular trichomes. In Oct 2021 she accepted the call for the W1 Professor in Computational Life Science in our Depratment.
